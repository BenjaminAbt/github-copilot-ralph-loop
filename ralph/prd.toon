  description: >
    Initialize a .NET 10 HelloWorld solution with randomized multilingual greetings
    and unit tests. The implementation must be deterministic enough to be testable
    and follow modern SDK-style project conventions.

context:
  framework: .NET 10.0
  language: C#
  build: dotnet build
  test: dotnet test

    description: >
      Create a new .NET 10 solution with a console application scaffolded
      in a standard repository layout to serve as a clean foundation
      for further development.

    acceptance:
      - A .slnx file exists at the repository root
      - Console project exists at src/HelloWorld
      - Target framework is net10.0
      - Nullable reference types are enabled
      - Implicit usings are enabled
      - Warnings are treated as errors

    notes:
      - Use modern SDK-style defaults
      - Set TreatWarningsAsErrors=true
      - Set Nullable=enable
      - Solution must use .slnx format

    description: >
      Implement greeting logic so the application prints exactly one
      random greeting in a different language on each startup.

    acceptance:
      - Project is added to the solution
      - Application prints exactly one greeting
      - Output includes greeting text
      - Output includes language
      - Greeting is selected from a predefined in-code list
      - Application runs via dotnet run

    notes:
      - Use a fixed list of (Language, Greeting) pairs
      - Randomize selection per startup
      - Output format example:
        "<Greeting> (<Language>)"
      - Output must remain deterministic enough for unit testing

    title: Tests
    priority: 3
    description: >
      Add unit tests to validate greeting selection logic independently
      from console output.

    acceptance:
      - Test project exists at tests/HelloWorld.Tests
      - Test project references HelloWorld
      - Tests validate only predefined greetings are returned
      - All tests pass

    notes:
      - Use xUnit (preferred)
      - Test a GreetingProvider or service
      - Avoid asserting console output
